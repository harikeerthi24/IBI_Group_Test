What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage?

Ans-
1.Cookies:
Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on your web browser. 
They are sent from the web server to your browser when you visit a website and are used to remember information about you or your preferences.
Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as remembering login credentials, tracking user behavior, or storing items in a shopping cart.
They have an expiration date, so they can be set to be persistent (stored for a longer time) or session-based (stored only until you close your browser).

2.Local Storage:
Local storage is a feature provided by web browsers that allows websites to store larger amounts of data (usually in key-value pairs) on your browser.
Unlike cookies, local storage data is not sent to the server with every request, which makes it faster and more efficient. 
The data stored in local storage remains on your browser until it is manually cleared by the user or by the website that stored it.
It is commonly used for saving user settings, caching data, or managing the state of a web application.

3.Session Storage:
Session storage is quite similar to local storage in terms of usage and syntax, but it has one key difference. 
While local storage data persists until explicitly removed, session storage data is only available for the duration of a single browsing session.
A browsing session ends when the user closes the browser tab or window.
This means that data stored in session storage is temporary and gets cleared automatically when the user ends their session.


Each of these mechanisms has its own use cases, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific needs of the web application or website.
