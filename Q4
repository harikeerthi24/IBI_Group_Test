What is promise chaining? Explain with an example?

Ans-
Promise chaining is a way of handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript using Promises, allowing you to execute multiple asynchronous tasks sequentially. 
It involves chaining then() and catch() methods to process the results or handle errors of each asynchronous operation.

EXAMPLE-
<script>
	let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	resolve("Hello");
	});
	
	promise
	.then( function (result1){
		console.log(result1);
		return new Promise((resolve,reject) =>{
			resolve("you're awesome");
		})
	})
	.then((result2) => {
		console.log(result2);
	});
</script>

OUTPUT- Hello 
        you're awesome

As above, while executing the declared promise we are returning another promise inside the .then() and executing our results accordingly. 
Another then is used to capture the new promise. This is known as promise chaining. This solves the problem of callback hell.
