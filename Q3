What is Sharding in MongoDB, and how does it work?

Ans-
  Sharding in MongoDB is a technique used to horizontally partition large datasets across multiple servers or shards. 
  It allows MongoDB to scale horizontally and handle massive amounts of data and high workloads efficiently.

Sharding works as follows:

1.Data Partitioning:
      The dataset is divided into smaller chunks called shards. Each shard is a separate MongoDB instance or a replica set.

2.Shard Key:
      MongoDB uses a shard key to determine which shard should store a specific document. 
      The shard key is chosen based on the data distribution and access patterns to ensure even distribution of data across shards.

3.Balancing:
      As data is inserted or grows, MongoDB automatically balances the data across shards to maintain an even distribution and prevent hotspots.

4.Routing: 
      When a query is executed, the MongoDB router analyzes the query based on the shard key and determines which shard to query. 
      It routes the query to the relevant shard.

5.Aggregation:
      If a query spans multiple shards, the router performs aggregation by gathering results from all relevant shards and returning the combined result.

Sharding allows MongoDB to scale out by adding more shards as the data grows, improving read/write performance and handling increasing workloads. 
It is a powerful mechanism to ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and efficient utilization of hardware resources in large-scale MongoDB deployments.
