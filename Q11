The given code has an issue with the initial accumulator value. 
The accumulator should be an object with properties evens and odds as arrays to store even and odd numbers respectively.

Fixed code-
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] });

Explanation:
The code uses the reduce() method to iterate through the numbers array. It accumulates the even numbers in the evens array and the odd numbers in the odds array.
The initial value of the accumulator is an object with evens and odds properties, both set to empty arrays { evens: [], odds: [] }.

RESULT-
{
  evens: [2, 4],
  odds: [1, 3, 5]
}

The evens array contains the even numbers [2, 4], and the odds array contains the odd numbers [1, 3, 5].
